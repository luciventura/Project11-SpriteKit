# Project11-SpriteKit
A game for iPads made using SpriteKit
My first project using SpriteKit. It works only on iPads. The player can tap anywhere on the screen to make balls fall in the slots. The green slots add one score and the red slots lose one score. 
For more fun, the player can edit the screen so it adds rectangular objects that make it more difficult to score.
